1.0:
  Navigate to websites
  Basic bookmark-support

1.1:
  Strip strings before displaying it (bookmarks)

1.1.2
  Bug: str.replace only returns value, so nothing is changed

development version:

1.2
  Now other protocols than http and https work. (file:// for example)
  Migrated to jQuery
  Back and forward buttons
  Auto reload
  Ability to switch between mobile and desktop user agent
  Now thereâ€™s a loading icon, so the user knows that something is happening. Also option to search instead.
  A couple of bug fixes.
